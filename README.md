# Image-Classification---FastAI

Image classification : This project is based on image classification using traditional Convolutional Neural Network and fast AI

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyse visual imagery. 
They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation equivariant responses known as feature maps. 
Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are only equivariant, as opposed to invariant, to translation. 
They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series.

The name convolutional neural network indicates that the network employs a mathematical operation called convolution. Convolution is a specialised kind of linear operation 

A CNN consists of an input, output and hidden layers. These consists of a series of convolutional layers.

FastAI simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices;
FastAI is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions.

The dataset used is Intel Image Classification which presents image data of Natural Scenes around the world.
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories:
'buildings','forest','glacier','mountain','sea','street'

There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.

The aim of the project is to build a ml algorithm which predicts the content/label of the test images.
